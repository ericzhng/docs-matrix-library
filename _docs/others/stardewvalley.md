Stardew Valley supports keyboards, mice and controllers, so you can use any combination you like.

## Stardew Valley setup
1. Open the Stardew Valley directory by right-clicking Stardew Valley in Steam -> Properties -> Local files -> Browse game files...

1. Launch Stardew Valley.exe as many times as you need. Make sure they are running in Windowed mode (click the square icon in the top-left). Resize the windows however you like. You can use the Toggle window borders in Universal Split Screen to trim the borders.

1. On any instance, go to Co-op -> Host -> Host one of your saves. Make sure you have cabins availible for players to use.

1. On all the other instances, go to Co-op -> Join LAN -> Leave the IP box empty -> Ok -> Click the save.

1. In the game's options, make sure `Use Hardware Cursor` is unchecked.

## Tips before you start
* If you have inconsistent mouse movement, especially when moving multiple mice, make sure the polling rates on your mice are set as low as possible. You can usually set this in your mouse configuration program (look on the manufacturer's website).

* Disable steam overlay by right-clicking Stardew Valley in Steam -> Properties and un-check 'Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game'

* Make sure to not use the same character in two instances, as it may break your save.

## Split screen setup
1. Install and run Universal Split Screen: see the [quick start guide](https://universalsplitscreen.github.io/docs/quickstart/)

1. In options, load the Stardew Valley preset.

1. Go back to the Current window tab. Alt+tab into the first instance. Set the mouse and keyboard or controller. Repeat for the other instances.

1. Click Start split screen. You should now be able to play. Press End to stop.
