## Installation
1. Download the latest release zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/UniversalSplitScreen/UniversalSplitScreen/releases/latest)

1. Extract the zip by right-clicking -> Extract all. Extract to wherever you like. Run UniversalSplitScreen.exe
    * If you get an error about .NET Framework, install latest version from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/on-windows-10
    
## Setup
1. Go to the options tab and load a [preset][guides page] or work out which ones you need (see [untested setup](https://universalsplitscreen.github.io/docs/untested/)). To load a presest, select it in the drop-down and click Load.

1. Launch multiple instances of the game and connect them in multiplayer (see the [guides][guides page] for more detail).
    * For Steam games, you will need to right-click on the game -> Properties -> Local files -> Browse local files... and launch the exe manually. 
    * You may find that the game will not let you run two instances. First try renaming steam_api.dll to steam_api.dll.disabled (or something) and seeing if that works. If it doesn't, see the page on the [Goldberg emulator](https://universalsplitscreen.github.io/docs/goldberg/).

1. Go back to the Current window tab in Universal Split Screen.

1. Alt-tab into a game, then back into Universal Split Screen. You should see the Window title and Window handle change (somtimes you will need to alt+tab twice). Set the mouse, keyboard and controller as necessary. Repeat for all the instances.
